*** Many small retailers often struggle with managing daily operations due to overreliance on manual systems in tracking stocks and record customer details. These outdated methods often result in data loss and human error which affects business performance. 
Hence, to address this issue, Clothifyâ€™s system is developed using Python and SQLite as database engine to provide a centralised platform that allows the business to manage customer data, track inventory, record sales, and process orders and payments more efficiently.
